# Spectrum_Calculator
The Spectrum Calculator is a web-based application designed to perform various calculations with an intuitive user interface. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, incorporating numerous modern web development techniques to ensure a responsive and user-friendly experience.

The calculator is designed to work seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes, thanks to CSS media queries. It utilizes CSS Grid for an organized and flexible layout and includes an image in the design to create a unique color blend. JavaScript is used extensively, with functions, objects, and DOM manipulation handling user interactions and calculations. Local storage is implemented to save and retrieve data, ensuring that user inputs persist even after refreshing the page. Various CSS properties such as box-shadow, padding, and margins are used to enhance the visual appeal of the buttons and other elements.

To install the project, clone the repository:
      git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spectrum-calculator.git
Navigate to the project directory:
      cd spectrum-calculator

To use the calculator, open the `Spectrum_Calculator.html` file in your web browser. Perform calculations using the on-screen buttons, and your inputs will be saved automatically and loaded upon refreshing the page.
